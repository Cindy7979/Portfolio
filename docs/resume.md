    

Hello.

     My name is Jinsuk Shin (Cindy).
    I would like to be considered for the position “Web Developer, Junior”.
    
     I have experience in Mobile Development and now I am learning Web Development which is enjoyable.
     
     If I have a chance to learn other programming skills in my work, I am always willing to do my best and have confidence to be good working with new programing languages. I love to expand my skill set and learn more about the industry. I am reliable and hard working with a great ‘can do’ attitude.
     
     I am living in Auckland, New Zealand and I am studying Multimedia at Tasman International Academy. I am looking for a part-time job.
